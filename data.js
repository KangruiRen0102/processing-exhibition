Observe the Bubbles and Contaminants: As the bubbles rise, they will grow and cluster when they encounter contaminants (white particles). The bubbles capture the contaminants, allowing them to float to the top, where they can be removed.\n4.	Change Environmental Conditions: You can modify the behavior of the bubbles by adjusting environmental factors. Press ‘W’ to increase or ‘S’ to decrease the current speed, which affects the horizontal drift of the bubbles. Press ‘D’ to increase or ‘A’ to decrease the liquid density, which will change how quickly the bubbles rise. Use ‘+’ to increase and ‘-’ to decrease the rise speed of all bubbles in the simulation, which shows how initial velocity or gas properties can increase how fast the bubbles rise. Note that you may need to press a key multiple times to see a visible effect, especially if you increased the condition previously and want to view a decrease or vice versa.\n5.	Visualize Dissolved Gases: Press ‘B’ to add additional bubbles representing dissolved gases. These gas bubbles will appear and grow as they rise.\n6.	Remove Contaminants: If you fail to remove a contaminant with the bubbles, it will grow larger to simulate the accumulation of pollution over time. The bubbles will remove the contaminants by growing and carrying them to the surface.\n7.	Clear Bubbles: Press ‘C’ to clear all bubbles currently in the system and start fresh.\n8.	Additional Interaction: Some bubbles will cluster together when they are close enough, meaning that they will travel at the same speed.
